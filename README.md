#### PLANNING STORY
What is it they say about the best laid plans?  I had to come up with something slightly useful and reasonable to my skill level.  My head was spinning fresh off the React lesson and while I could have probably done this in Ruby without as much assistance as I ended up requiring, at the end of the day I definitely feel Express is pounded into my head for future use.  So that's where we are with planning.

#### UNSOLVED PROBLEMS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
At this point there's no unsolved problems as much as there are yet to be installed features so YAY!  In the future we'd like to add code for a randomizer button that will return a quote at random but going to market had to take precedence.
